Course is divided into  three parts, each exploring a different aspect of convex optimization: 1)  algorithmic frameworks; 2) Oracle complexities; 3) the power of randomness.  Through this course students are exposed to general concepts of convex  geometry, learning theory, and rigorous proofs. (formerly CMPS 290O.)",
